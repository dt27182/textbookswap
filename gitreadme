How to use git:

1. goto your own branch
	git checkout your-branch
2. make some changes
	ajsdl;jfa;lks
3. add, commit , push to your own branch
	git commit (to check which files have changed)
	git add ...
	git commit -m "commit-message"
	git push origin your-branch
4. update your local master from from the remote repo
	git checkout master
	git pull origin master
5. pull in the changes from master into your branch
	git checkout your-branch
	git merge master
6. push those changes to your remote branch

7. update the master branch with your changes
	git checkout master
