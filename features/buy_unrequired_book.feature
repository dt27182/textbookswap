  As a buyer, once I have selected a class
  So that I can buy a book that is relevant to the class but is not officiallyâ€‹ listed
  I want to be able to select an unlisted book offered by sellers

  Given the expiration time is "20" months
  Given the "Computer Science" department is offering course number "169"
  Given the "10th Edition" edition of the book "Armando Fox Autobiography" exists
  Given the "10th Edition" edition of the book "Armando Fox Autobiography" is an unrequired book for course number "169" in the "Computer Science" department
  Given I am on the Buy Books page for course number "169" in the "Computer Science" department
